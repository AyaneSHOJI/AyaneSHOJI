👋 Hi, I’m @AyaneSHOJI : C# .Net junior developer.</br>
</br>

🌱 I am currently working on Blazor projects with C# as an intern, back-end oriented, but interested in any other aspects of development.</br>    
</br>

✨ My favorite app is Doctolib : medical booking service MADE IN FRANCE. I can talk about it at least 2-3 hours if you wish.</br>
