- 👋 Hi, I’m @AyaneSHOJI : C# junior developer, intern until december 2021</br>
    </br>
    
- 🌱 I am currently working on a project on Blazor with C#.
    
    After working as a language teacher, then an assistant in the automobile industry, here I am for professional reorientation. 

    I found my passion for coding during Covid lockdown in 2020 when I have been going mad with my 2 little kids (quite tough to stay with them 24h/24h, you know...). </br>
    </br>
    By myself, I started to learn HTML, CSS and luckily integrated in a 1 month coding boot camp of Swift for iOS app development. It was a great pleasure for me to make something by coding and I couldn't forget my feeling when this app worked for the first time.</br> 
    </br>
    From February 2021, I joined a local programming school, Webforce3, in order to have solid bases and to specialize in PHP. Every day I enjoy my class and I'm looking forward to doing new projects!

- 👀 I’m interested in web development, mobile app development, cooking (Japanese dishes), travel, movies, taÏ-chi.</br>
      </br>
     My favorite service is Doctolib : medical booking service MADE IN FRANCE. I can talk about it at least 2-3 hours if you wish. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun & useful project.
